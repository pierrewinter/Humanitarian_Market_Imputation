# Delivering Cash-Based Assistance to Syrian Communities :ambulance:  
Humanitarian aid organizations are unable to provide accurate cash-based assistance in conflict regions. This is often due to the lack of pricing information for basic necessities found in local markets. How can we estimate missing prices of market goods in Syria such that families in need are given an adequate amount of aid?

**Project Overview**

This repository contains source code, supporting data, and a final written report of our data science solution. It was developed in 8 weeks by a team of 4 data scientists at ETH Zurich. We collaborated with IMPACT Initiatives, an NGO which monitors and evaluates humanitarian interventions in order to support aid actors in assessing the efficacy of their programs. We present analytical methods which impute missing price values and allow for more effective cash-based humanitarian programming in conflict regions around the world.

**Solutions**

Three distinct methods to impute a sparse matrix of price data have been made available as follows.

Sequential Forward Fill - Python

Adapted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Python

Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) - R
